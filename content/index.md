Hey, I’m Sandi, a PhD student at [Kühne Logistics University](https://www.klu.org/faculty-research/phd-program/phd-students/sandra-rudeloff) in Hamburg, Germany, and this is where I share all the cool things I come across during my research journey! 🎓 Whether it’s about methods for tracing foodborne diseases or figuring out how to visualize massive datasets, I’m diving into whatever excites me and following my curiosities.

My blog and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYRAqtpgWTRrAgfKBiQVKOA) are a mix of hands-on tutorials and personal reflections— sometimes academic 📚, sometimes just really fun life stuff 🎉. Right now, it’s a bit of a one-post show, but there’s plenty more in the works! 😄

When I’m not deep into research 👩🏼‍💻, you’ll find me volunteering as a firefighter with [Freiwillige Feuerwehr Ottensen/Bahrenfeld](https://www.ff-ottensen.de/) 🧑🏻‍🚒🔥 or throwing around weights at [CrossFit Sankt Pauli](https://www.sanktpauliathletik.com/) 🏋️‍♀️💪.

Feel free to browse around! I hope you find something that sparks your interest too.
