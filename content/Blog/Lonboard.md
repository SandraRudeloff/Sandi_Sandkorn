**Did you ever want to visualize massive amounts of spatial data interactively with Python, only to find that libraries like `folium` or `pydeck` can’t quite keep up?**

Imagine handling and visualizing Germany’s population data - consisting of around 3 million 100m x 100m polygons - with ease and efficiency. In this post, I’ll introduce you to the powerful Python library [`lonboard`](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/). and show you how it can make this a reality.

We’ll start with an overview of `lonboard` and why it stands out from other libraries. Then, dive into a hands-on example using a [`Jupyter`](https://jupyter.org/) notebook to experience firsthand how `lonboard` turns raw census data into compelling interactive visualizations. 

**Full Notebook**

To get the full hands-on experience, you’ll need the complete notebook that walks you through preparing the data, setting up the visualizations, and exploring Germany’s population data interactively.

You can view the full notebook directly [[../scripts/Visualize Germany's Population using lonboard|here]] or download and explore the hosted version [here](https://notebooksharing.space/view/96ca38ffb899c1b760fdf42800ced3a760bdc14d8cf1430a974307961dff8ce2#displayOptions=).

**How `lonboard`’s Advanced Architecture Enhances Geospatial Visualization**

`lonboard` transforms geospatial data visualization with its powerful GPU-based rendering and efficient data handling technologies. Unlike most other libraries that rely on [`GeoJSON`](https://geojson.org/), `lonboard` leverages advanced formats like [`GeoArrow`](https://geoarrow.org/) and [`GeoParquet`](https://geoparquet.org/)to ensure fast, interactive experiences even with massive datasets. For more details on how it works, explore further [here](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/how-it-works/).

**Understanding Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)**

When visualizing spatial data, one key concept to understand is *Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)*, which helps translate our 3D world onto flat 2D maps.

- The *World Geodetic System of 1984* (WGS84)  is the standard system used for most global maps. It works by fitting the entire Earth onto a flat map and uses latitude and longitude to pinpoint locations. It is referenced with the EPSG code 4326.
- For Germany’s population data, the *European Terrestrial Reference System of 1989 (ETRS89) with the Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area projection* is used. This system is specifically tailored for Europe and uses meters for measurements. Think of it as the “European specialist” for regional maps. It is referenced with the EPSG Code 3035.
