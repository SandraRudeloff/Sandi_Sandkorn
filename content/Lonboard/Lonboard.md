**Intro**
- Ever struggled to make an interactively visualization of massive amounts of spatial data on a map?
- Ever wanted to visualize huge amounts of data, such as population data in Germany in 100mx100m grid cells?

Should I include how I transformed the data from .csv to a geodataframe?
3,088,037 rows

- build on deck.gl
- do it with longboard
* why only in jupyter?
* use a new virtual environment so that you can show what to install and why
* Explain about CSR and how it was in the European one before
* use population data as example
* Show the result in the beginning and how I wanted to visualize it to get a sense of the data and whether it behaves as I expect 
* interactive
* why is lonboard so much more performant than other
* Option: folium, deck.gl (but somehow lonboard is build upon it)
* why log? many more little inhabitated cells

shiny would be an option to build a web app, but I haven't tested that yet
